Design a database solution for the railway network. The enquiry system should have the following information:

●	Station names
●	Train IDs with names
●	Weekly Schedules of the trains
●	Ticket Availability
●	Cost of trip

The train schedules should have information on the stations from where the train starts and by when it reaches the
destination. It should also include information about all stations it passes through during its journey."""
